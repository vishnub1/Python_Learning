# A module in Python is a file containing Python code (functions, classes, variables, etc.)
# that you can import and reuse in other programs. Modules help in code organization,
# reusability, and maintainability.

# Math_operations.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

# now you can import and use this module in another python script
